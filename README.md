ToDo-MVC

------------
Program made to manage tasks in MVC pattern for a school assignment.
User can create, modify tasks and save them to file as user profile (save all user data).
Works in terminal.

MVC pattern:

Controller takes data from Model, creates own Views (using data module) for varied User actions.
Controller takes input from User, affects on Model and calls specific View to display result in terminal.

Start program with main.py file.
