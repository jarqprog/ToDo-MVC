ToDo-MVC

------------
Program made to manage tasks in MVC pattern for a school assignment.
User can create, modify tasks and save them to file as user profile (save all user data).
Works in terminal.

MVC pattern:

Controller takes data from Model, creates own Views (using data module) for varied User actions,
collects Views instances in dictionary.

Controller takes input from User, affects on Model and calls specific View (from dictionary)
to display result in terminal.

Old program version in branch version_1 - presents different approach (one View for all User actions, takes
various arguments to display changes).
